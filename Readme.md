# Javascript-challenge

This is the first JS Challenge created by BootCamp for the University of Toronto. 
In this challenge divided into two(2) sections; UFO Level 1, and UFO Level 2(optional)
there will be two js files, one containing the data and the other the app. 

All these will be called into effect via the index.html file. Please note that developpment took place on both W10 20H2, and OSX 11.1 (20C69) with FireFox and Brave used as the baseline drivers as Chrome is not welcome by the developper.
